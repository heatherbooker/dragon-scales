- push `gh-pages`

## how to use

- open `index.html` in your broswer
- sit at piano
- play scales! make beautiful musics!

## TO DO

- key signatures
- label difficulty dial prettier
- implement rhythms scale types
- implement contrary motions scale types
- add fingerings
- full on dan mode
- add choice of clefs
- add bass clef: for both hands
- the way a scale is chosen is naive:
    get one at random, 
    check whether the checkbox for it is true
    try again until we get lucky.
    there are easier ways!
- github action doesn't work (should trigger on push main branch)
